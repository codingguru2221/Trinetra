# 🔱 Trinetra – The All-Seeing Vulnerability Scanner

> **“See Beyond the Surface — Detect. Defend. Secure.”**

**Trinetra** is an advanced **Java-based cybersecurity tool** built to **detect vulnerabilities, analyze web threats, and strengthen digital defenses**.
Inspired by **Lord Shiva’s Third Eye — the Trinetra**, it represents *divine perception* and *unmatched awareness* in the cyber realm.

Trinetra’s mission is simple yet powerful:
to help cybersecurity experts **uncover hidden weaknesses**, **identify potential exploits**, and **defend systems before they’re breached**.



## 🌐 Overview

In the constantly evolving landscape of the internet, vulnerabilities can emerge anywhere — from unpatched code to exposed endpoints.
**Trinetra** acts as an **intelligent sentinel**, scanning websites and applications to detect security gaps that traditional tools might overlook.

It empowers analysts and ethical hackers with actionable insights, ensuring that every potential threat is **seen, understood, and neutralized**.


## ⚔️ What Trinetra Does

* **🛡️ Vulnerability Detection:**
  Identifies misconfigurations, outdated components, and exploitable web weaknesses.

* **🔍 Deep Scan Engine:**
  Analyzes HTML, headers, responses, and security headers for signs of exposure.

* **⚡ Threat Intelligence:**
  Detects suspicious scripts, cross-site vulnerabilities, injection points, and insecure endpoints.

* **📜 Detailed Reporting:**
  Generates clear vulnerability summaries to support mitigation and patching efforts.

* **🧠 Analyst-Friendly Insights:**
  Provides organized results with descriptions, severity levels, and recommendations.



## 🕵️ Attack Spectrum — What Trinetra Detects

Trinetra’s scanning modules are built to recognize a **wide range of modern web attacks** — from the classic to the cutting-edge.
It doesn’t just look for surface-level bugs; it exposes the *patterns of exploitation* that threaten your digital assets.

### 🧩 Injection Attacks

* **SQL Injection (SQLi)** — detects data manipulation or DB control via malicious queries.
* **Command Injection** — identifies input vectors allowing OS command execution.
* **LDAP & XML Injection (XXE)** — catches unsafe query and parser handling.
* **NoSQL Injection** — finds query-based injections in document DBs (e.g., MongoDB).

### ⚡ Cross-Site Threats

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** — detects stored, reflected, and DOM-based XSS payloads.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** — flags missing tokens and unsafe state-changing requests.
* **Clickjacking** — identifies missing `X-Frame-Options` or CSP headers.

### 🔐 Authentication & Access Flaws

* **Broken Authentication** — weak login flows, credential exposures, insecure session IDs.
* **Broken Access Control / IDOR** — detects endpoints exposing unauthorized data.
* **Privilege Escalation Points** — scans for misconfigured role or permission boundaries.

### 🧱 Server & Configuration Weaknesses

* **Security Misconfiguration** — exposed admin panels, default creds, verbose error messages.
* **Directory Traversal** — identifies path manipulation vulnerabilities.
* **Insecure File Uploads** — detects unrestricted or malicious file handling.
* **Unprotected Endpoints** — reveals APIs without auth or rate limits.

### 🔒 Data & Privacy Risks

* **Sensitive Data Exposure** — identifies unencrypted traffic, weak crypto, leaked secrets.
* **Information Disclosure** — catches debug traces, stack dumps, or version leaks.
* **Open Redirects** — finds redirect parameters that could enable phishing.

### 🌐 Network & Server Attacks

* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** — detects outbound request abuse to internal systems.
* **Host Header Injection** — identifies potential cache poisoning and redirection flaws.
* **DNS Rebinding / Misrouted Calls** — highlights insecure server validation of hostnames.

### ⚙️ Advanced Exploitation Vectors

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** — analyzes input handling that may lead to code execution.
* **Insecure Deserialization** — detects unsafe object parsing in serialized data streams.
* **Prototype Pollution (JS Apps)** — flags client-side data structure manipulation risks.
* **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfigurations** — detects permissive origins and unsafe headers.


## 🔱 Why Trinetra?

Because the first step to defense is **detection**.
**Trinetra** enables cybersecurity professionals to act before attackers do — by providing a **watchful third eye** over web infrastructure.

Where others see code, Trinetra sees **risk**.
Where others see logs, Trinetra finds **patterns**.
It’s not just a scanner — it’s a **guardian** built for the defenders of the digital world.


## 💡 Philosophy

> “Awareness is protection. Vision is power.”

Trinetra represents the union of **ancient vision** and **modern cybersecurity**.
It’s a symbol of vigilance — always watching, always learning, always evolving to uncover the unseen threats that lie beneath the web’s surface.

Every scan brings clarity.
Every alert strengthens defense.
Every vulnerability revealed is a step toward security.



## 🚀 Future Vision

* Integration of **AI-driven vulnerability classification**
* Real-time **threat alerts and risk scoring**
* Support for **multi-domain scanning and report comparison**
* **Community plug-in system** for adding new vulnerability modules
